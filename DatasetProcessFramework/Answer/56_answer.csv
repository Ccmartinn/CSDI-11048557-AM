Question,Answer
Q1,A1: Eight stars have a magnitude greater than zero currently:   - Epsilon Canis Majoris: 1.5   - Beta Canis Majoris: 1.99   - Capella: 0.08   - Beta Aurigae: 1.9   - Zeta Leporis: 3.55   - Upsilon Librae: 3.6   - Zeta Sagittarii: 2.6   - Vega: 0.03
Q2,A2: Six stars have a current magnitude of at least 1.0:   - Epsilon Canis Majoris: 1.5  - Beta Canis Majoris: 1.99   - Beta Aurigae: 1.9 - Zeta Leporis: 3.55   - Upsilon Librae: 3.6   - Zeta Sagittarii: 2.6
Q3,A3: The difference in distance between Epsilon Canis Majoris (430.0 ly) and Zeta Sagittarii (89.1 ly) is 430.0 - 89.1 = 340.9 light years.
Q4,A4: Thirteen stars have a distance at maximum of 30 light years or higher:
Q5,"A5: Yes, Capella's current magnitude (0.08) is more than Vega's current magnitude (0.03)."
Q6,A6: The difference in the nearest current distance (Sirius: 8.6 ly) and farthest current distance (Beta Canis Majoris: 500.0 ly) is 500.0 - 8.6 = 491.4 light years.
Q7,A7: Eleven stars do not have a current magnitude greater than zero (they are zero or negative):
Q8,A8: Beta Cygni has the highest distance at maximum of the listed entries at 80.0 light years.
Q9,A9: Beta Cygni is the only star with a distance at maximum of 80 light years.
Q10,A10: All eighteen entries listed have a maximum magnitude less than zero.
